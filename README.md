# lagrange-sim

This small project aims to show existance and stability of Lagrange points. 
It should also answer the questing whether the system can be (at least partially)
simulated mechanically by rotating 3d printed Newton potential.

## Troubleshooting

### Python scripts

If your matplotlib doesn't work as you would expect, try to change your backend in the `matplotlibrc` file.
See [here](https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/introductory/customizing.html#customizing-with-matplotlibrc-files) for details.
